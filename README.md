# Project-Ion
A hardware &amp; software stack for a simple computer that runs on a FPGA

This is my own implementation of the bitwise project

##Bitwise
Bitwise is a free educational project about building the software and hardware stack for a simple computer from scratch, running on an FPGA. This includes all the systems software, including operating system, compiler, etc, as well as the HDL source code for the CPU, graphics chip, peripheral controllers--all of it.

By watching daily or bidaily streams on Twitch, uploaded later as videos to YouTube, reading blog posts and articles, and studying code pushed daily to GitHub, you will get to watch over my shoulder as I build the system from scratch, starting with an empty source control repository, and you will learn how everything works so you can build it yourself too. Most code will be written off stream, but every new line of code will be covered during code reviews at the beginning of each stream.
